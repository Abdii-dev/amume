        <h2>Malaria effect on African children</h2>
Children dies of malaria every minute, and most of them are African children and it remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa.  Annually More than 260 000 African children under the age of five die from malaria. The heaviest burden of the disease and  expect many more African children.In sub-Saharan Africa, Cerebral malaria (CM) occurs mainly in children under five years of age. Caused by Plasmodium falciparum is a fatal neurological complication of malaria, resulting in coma and death, and even survivors may suffer long-term neurological sequelae Although intravenous artesunate is considered the preferred treatment for CM, the clinical efficacy is still far-off satisfactory. The neurological damage induced by CM is irreparable and lethal, and it is therefore of great significance to unravel the exact etiology of CM, which may be beneficial for the effective management of this severe disease. Clinical characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical therapy of CM, with the aim of providing insights into the development of novel tools for improved CM treatments. Evidence synthesis of the factors associated with malaria among children aged under-five in SSA is urgently needed because, Sub-Saharan Africa is the most malaria-endemic region in the world. Accordingly, There are combination of factors in Africa that make most affected to malaria: very efficient mosquito is high transmission, The predominant parasite species that cause severe malaria Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most widespread on region, That causing severe malaria and death in region, Local weather conditions of the region, Scarce resources and socio-economic instability have hindered efficient mala ria control activities.  In addition to this the challenges of malaria control efforts on the SSA are; antimalarial drug resistance in East Africa, HRP2 gene deletions, mosquito resistance to insecticides, invasive vector species (Anopheles stephensi) in the horn of Africa. Also, more than 90% of the disease and nearly all deaths occur in children Adding to this high burden is the co-existence of intestinal and genito-urinary helminth infections.
