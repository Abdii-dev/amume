        <h2><strong>MALARIA</strong></h2>
<p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite. It is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – P. Falciparum that can severe illness and death and P. Vivax – pose the greatest threat, P. Ovale, and P. Malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. Closely half of the world's population was at risk of malaria in 2021. Some population groups are at considerably higher risk of contracting malaria and developing severe disease: children under 5 years of age, infants, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS, as well as people with low immunity moving to areas with intense malaria transmission such as migrant workers, travellers and mobile populations.</P> 
  <P>The disease is the consequence of infection by a protozoan parasite from the genus Plasmodium with most morbidity and mortality caused by P. Falciparum. Global concern despite substantial reduction in incidence over the past twenty years. Public health interventions to increase the uptake of preventive measures have contributed to this decline but their impact has not been uniform.</P> 
  <p> Malaria imposes substantial costs to both governments and individuals. Costs to governments include maintenance, supply and staffing of health facilities; purchase of drugs and supplies; public health interventions against malaria, such as insecticide spraying or distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets; lost days of work with resulting loss of income; and lost opportunities for joint economic ventures and tourism. Costs to individuals and their families include purchase of drugs for treating malaria at home; expenses for travel to, and treatment at, clinics and dispensaries; lost days of work; absence from school; expenses for preventive measures; and expenses for burial in case of deaths. it occurs mostly in poor tropical and subtropical areas of the world. In many of the countries affected by malaria, it is a leading cause of illness and death. In areas with high transmission, the most vulnerable groups are young children, and pregnant women. The costs of malaria – to individuals, families, communities, nations – are enormous.</P>
   <P>WHO report Africa the hardest  malaria disease the WHO African Region globally 95% of all malaria cases and 96% of deaths, from this deaths 80% of region are Children under age of 5 years. Specially the disease is major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, and children are most vulnerable in 2019, estimated 409,000 people died of malaria, most (274,000) were young children and 94% of the cases and deaths were in Africa. That is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality especially in pregnant women and under-five-year-old children. However, data on the prevalence among delivering mothers, potential fetal transmission, and associated birth outcomes is lacking in Ethiopia.</P>
<P>Ethiopia is among sub-Saharan African countries with most of the landmass favoring the breeding of the vectors and high number of malaria cases each year. In the country malaria disease is one of the public health problems, and it is still among the top ten leading causes of morbidity and mortality among under-five children. Nevertheless, the studies conducted in the country have been inconclusive and inconsistent.</p>    
    <p>Sleeping under ITN, having two and more ITN for the household, altitude, availability of radio, and television were the predictors of malaria among under-five children in Ethiopia. In Oromia region From a total of 190 weredas and 6, 107 kebe/es of the regions 172 (9.5%) weredas and 3,932 (64.4%) kebe/es were found to be partially or completely prove to malaria, with about 65% of the total population residing in these areas. The two most important causes of malaria during the period were 51.5% P. Falciparum and 32.3% P vivax, comprising of and of he case [10]. Analysis comprised all Oromia secondary and tertiary facilities; only 3.4% of health centers and 13.0% of hospitals surveyed had no data, suggesting that given the extensive data reported.  Patients were predominantly seen at health centers rather than at hospitals.</P>
<P>When the diseases affect all age, children are three times higher than adults and risk factor associated with malaria illness at an individual level. In children that diseases is the second leading cause of death next to diarrheal, with middle and low-income countries accounting for over 9 in 10 incidence and deaths and common causes of death in children. In developing countries like Ethiopia, it is leading causes of mortality and morbidity among under five children. From all children around the globe 20 percent have malaria parasites in their blood. When P. Falciparum is the most lethal of the five strains of malaria, and is a major case of morbidity and mortality in endemic regions. The protection and effectiveness provided by the vaccine are strong, and it can be effectively delivered through the routine child immunization platform. The economic cost of the vaccine remains to be considered</P>

      <h2>Vulnerability of children to malaria</h2>
<P>Under-five year children are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria, they are high percent of all malaria deaths worldwide. According to center for disease control and prevention, in regions where malaria is prevalent Children have a higher risk of mortality than most adults due to their immunity. Certain groups of people are at higher risk for contracting malaria and developing severe symptoms: children under five years of age, infants, pregnant women whose immunity is decreased by pregnancy, people living with HIV/AIDS, non-immune migrants, mobile populations, and travelers. Children under five are by far the most vulnerable group as they accounted malaria deaths worldwide in 2019. Children are susceptible to severe malarial infection because they are too young to have developed partial immunity to the illness while Adults who have lived in malaria-endemic regions for most of their lives develop some protection against infection from years of exposure. Children are too young to have developed this type of immunity in their short lifespans, as their immune systems are still developing so reactions to the illness can be very severe and lead to death.Similarly, an area where there is low and unstable malaria transmission, and people have law or no   immunity are more commonly affected by the disease. Travel to new rural areas to high transmission areas, and in young children. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude of association across the studies, the pooled estimate travel as an important risk factor for malaria infection.  In addition, the vulnerability of Under-five year children to malaria are: Outdoor stay at night, stagnant water near to house, and number of under-five children per household. Most risk factor Health information dissemination that focuses on avoiding outdoor stay at night, eliminating stagnant water & using ITN, and considering number of under-five children per household during ITN distribution should be take into account</P>
