  <h2>Global burden of malaria on childre</h2>
  <P>Malaria remains a huge burden on global public health. Annually there are more than 200 million cases with > 600,000 deaths worldwide.  The percentage of total malaria deaths in children aged under 5 years reduced from 87% in 2000 to 76% in 2015. Since there has been no change. The cases and deaths Malaria averted Worldwide estimated 2 billion malaria cases and 11.7 million malaria deaths were averted in the period 2000â€“2021. Most of the cases (82%) and deaths (95%) averted were in the WHO African Region, followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (cases 10% and deaths 3%). The disease is remains one of the major global and national public health threats, affecting millions of people yearly by causing substantial morbidity and mortality. In developing countries, higher proportions of poor malaria prevention and control measure both regionally and nationally. It is the fifth most lethal parasitic infection in the world. Antimalarial medications have played a crucial role in preventing and eradicating malaria. Numerous heterocyclic moieties have been incorporated into the creation of effective antimalarial drugs. One third of the global population affected by malaria and intestinal helminths, largely among communities with severe poverty. 
   Malaria has been a major parasitic disease in tropical and subtropical regions and is estimated to kill between one and two million people (mainly children) every year. Novel anti-malarial agents are urgently needed to combat the malarial parasites enduring resistance to the current medications, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. There has been a significant reduction in malaria morbidity and mortality worldwide from 2000 to 2019. Nevertheless, the incidence and mortality increased again in 2020 due to the disruption to services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveillance to reduce the burden of malaria, eliminate the disease and prevent it retransmission.</P>
