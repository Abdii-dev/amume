        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite[1]. It is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – P. Falciparum that can severe illness and death and P. Vivax – pose the greatest threat, P. Ovale, and P. Malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. Closely half of the world's population was at risk of malaria in 2021. Some population groups are at considerably higher risk of contracting malaria and developing severe disease: children under 5 years of age, infants, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS, as well as people with low immunity moving to areas with intense malaria transmission such as migrant workers, travellers and mobile populations[2].</P> 
  <P>The disease is the consequence of infection by a protozoan parasite from the genus Plasmodium with most morbidity and mortality caused by P. Falciparum.[3]. Global concern despite substantial reduction in incidence over the past twenty years. Public health interventions to increase the uptake of preventive measures have contributed to this decline but their impact has not been uniform.[4].</P> 
  <p> Malaria imposes substantial costs to both governments and individuals. Costs to governments include maintenance, supply and staffing of health facilities; purchase of drugs and supplies; public health interventions against malaria, such as insecticide spraying or distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets; lost days of work with resulting loss of income; and lost opportunities for joint economic ventures and tourism. Costs to individuals and their families include purchase of drugs for treating malaria at home; expenses for travel to, and treatment at, clinics and dispensaries; lost days of work; absence from school; expenses for preventive measures; and expenses for burial in case of deaths. it occurs mostly in poor tropical and subtropical areas of the world. In many of the countries affected by malaria, it is a leading cause of illness and death. In areas with high transmission, the most vulnerable groups are young children, and pregnant women. The costs of malaria – to individuals, families, communities, nations – are enormous[5].</P>
   <P>WHO report Africa the hardest  malaria disease the WHO African Region globally 95% of all malaria cases and 96% of deaths, from this deaths 80% of region are Children under age of 5 years[2]. Specially the disease is major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, and children are most vulnerable in 2019, estimated 409,000 people died of malaria, most (274,000) were young children and 94% of the cases and deaths were in Africa[6]. That is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality especially in pregnant women and under-five-year-old children. However, data on the prevalence among delivering mothers, potential fetal transmission, and associated birth outcomes is lacking in Ethiopia[7].</P>
<P>Ethiopia is among sub-Saharan African countries with most of the landmass favoring the breeding of the vectors and high number of malaria cases each year[8]. In the country malaria disease is one of the public health problems, and it is still among the top ten leading causes of morbidity and mortality among under-five children. Nevertheless, the studies conducted in the country have been inconclusive and inconsistent.</p>    
    <p>Sleeping under ITN, having two and more ITN for the household, altitude, availability of radio, and television were the predictors of malaria among under-five children in Ethiopia[9].  In Oromia region From a total of 190 weredas and 6, 107 kebe/es of the regions 172 (9().5%) weredas and 3,932 (64.4%) kebe/es were found to be partially or completely prove to malaria, with about 65% of the total population residing in these areas. The two most important causes of malaria during the period were 51.5% P. Falciparum and 32.3% P vivax, comprising of and of he case [10]. Analysis comprised all Oromia secondary and tertiary facilities; only 3.4% of health centers and 13.0% of hospitals surveyed had no data, suggesting that given the extensive data reported.  Patients were predominantly seen at health centers rather than at hospitals[11]</P>.
<P>When the diseases affect all age, children are three times higher than adults and risk factor associated with malaria illness at an individual level[12]. In children that diseases is the second leading cause of death next to diarrheal, with middle and low-income countries accounting for over 9 in 10 incidence and deaths[13] and common causes of death in children[14]. In developing countries like Ethiopia, it is leading causes of mortality and morbidity among under five children[15]. From all children around the globe 20 percent have malaria parasites in their blood. When P. Falciparum is the most lethal of the five strains of malaria, and is a major case of morbidity and mortality in endemic regions.  The protection and effectiveness provided by the vaccine are strong, and it can be effectively delivered through the routine child immunization platform. The economic cost of the vaccine remains to be considered[16]</P>

      <h2>Vulnerability of children to malaria</h2>
<P>Under-five year children are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria, they are high percent of all malaria deaths worldwide[17]. According to center for disease control and prevention, in regions where malaria is prevalent Children have a higher risk of mortality than most adults due to their immunity. Certain groups of people are at higher risk for contracting malaria and developing severe symptoms: children under five years of age, infants, pregnant women whose immunity is decreased by pregnancy, people living with HIV/AIDS, non-immune migrants, mobile populations, and travelers. Children under five are by far the most vulnerable group as they accounted malaria deaths worldwide in 2019. Children are susceptible to severe malarial infection because they are too young to have developed partial immunity to the illness while Adults who have lived in malaria-endemic regions for most of their lives develop some protection against infection from years of exposure. Children are too young to have developed this type of immunity in their short lifespans, as their immune systems are still developing so reactions to the illness can be very severe and lead to death[5].  
Similarly, an area where there is low and unstable malaria transmission, and people have law or no   immunity are more commonly affected by the disease [18]. Travel to new rural areas to high transmission areas, and in young children. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude of association across the studies, the pooled estimate travel as an important risk factor for malaria infection[19].  In addition, the vulnerability of Under-five year children to malaria are: Outdoor stay at night, stagnant water near to house, and number of under-five children per household. Most risk factor Health information dissemination that focuses on avoiding outdoor stay at night, eliminating stagnant water & using ITN, and considering number of under-five children per household during ITN distribution should be take into account[17]</P>
      <h2>Global burden of malaria on childre</h2>
<P>Malaria remains a huge burden on global public health. Annually there are more than 200 million cases with > 600,000 deaths worldwide.  The percentage of total malaria deaths in children aged under 5 years reduced from 87% in 2000 to 76% in 2015. Since there has been no change[2]. The cases and deaths Malaria averted Worldwide estimated 2 billion malaria cases and 11.7 million malaria deaths were averted in the period 2000–2021. Most of the cases (82%) and deaths (95%) averted were in the WHO African Region, followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (cases 10% and deaths 3%)[20]. The disease is remains one of the major global and national public health threats, affecting millions of people yearly by causing substantial morbidity and mortality. In developing countries, higher proportions of poor malaria prevention and control measure both regionally and nationally[21]. It is the fifth most lethal parasitic infection in the world. Antimalarial medications have played a crucial role in preventing and eradicating malaria. Numerous heterocyclic moieties have been incorporated into the creation of effective antimalarial drugs[22]. One third of the global population affected by malaria and intestinal helminths, largely among communities with severe poverty[23]. 
 Malaria has been a major parasitic disease in tropical and subtropical regions and is estimated to kill between one and two million people (mainly children) every year. Novel anti-malarial agents are urgently needed to combat the malarial parasites enduring resistance to the current medications, leading to increased morbidity and mortality[24]. There has been a significant reduction in malaria morbidity and mortality worldwide from 2000 to 2019. Nevertheless, the incidence and mortality increased again in 2020 due to the disruption to services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveillance to reduce the burden of malaria, eliminate the disease and prevent it retransmission[25].</P>

<h2>Malaria effect on African childrenh</h2>
<p>Children dies of malaria every minute, and most of them are African children and it remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa.  Annually More than 260 000 African children under the age of five die from malaria. The heaviest burden of the disease and  expect many more African children[2].  In sub-Saharan Africa, Cerebral malaria (CM) occurs mainly in children under five years of age. Caused by Plasmodium falciparum is a fatal neurological complication of malaria, resulting in coma and death, and even survivors may suffer long-term neurological sequelae Although intravenous artesunate is considered the preferred treatment for CM, the clinical efficacy is still far-off satisfactory. The neurological damage induced by CM is irreparable and lethal, and it is therefore of great significance to unravel the exact etiology of CM, which may be beneficial for the effective management of this severe disease. Clinical characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical therapy of CM, with the aim of providing insights into the development of novel tools for improved CM treatments[26]. Evidence synthesis of the factors associated with malaria among children aged under-five in SSA is urgently needed because, Sub-Saharan Africa is the most malaria-endemic region in the world[27]. Accordingly, There are combination of factors in Africa that make most affected to malaria: very efficient mosquito is high transmission, The predominant parasite species that cause severe malaria Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most widespread on region, That causing severe malaria and death in region, Local weather conditions of the region, Scarce resources and socio-economic instability have hindered efficient mala ria control activities[5].  In addition to this the challenges of malaria control efforts on the SSA are; antimalarial drug resistance in East Africa, HRP2 gene deletions, mosquito resistance to insecticides, invasive vector species (Anopheles stephensi) in the horn of Africa[2]. Also, more than 90% of the disease and nearly all deaths occur in children Adding to this high burden is the co-existence of intestinal and genito-urinary helminth infections[28].</p>
